# Do NOT remove the VITE_ prefix!

# Polymarket Wallet Credentials

# Your wallet's private key (64 hex characters, must start with 0x)
# Get this from your wallet (MetaMask, etc.)

# Your trading proxy wallet address (40 hex characters, must start with 0x)
# Find this at: polymarket.com/settings
# This is DIFFERENT from your regular wallet address!

# Polymarket API Credentials (L2 Authentication + GASLESS TRADING)
# --------------------------------------------
# These credentials serve TWO purposes:
# 1. L2 Authentication - Access your account data and place orders
# 2. GASLESS TRADING - Enable fee-free trading via Polymarket's Relayer
#
# You can get these by:
# - Using client.createApiKey() or client.deriveApiKey()
# - Or from polymarket.com/settings (if available)
# - Or from your Builder Profile at: https://polymarket.com/builders
#
# NOTE: These are the SAME credentials for both L2 auth and gasless trading!
# All gas fees are paid by Polymarket when using the relayer!

# --------------------------------------------
# Important Notes:
# --------------------------------------------
# • VITE_PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS is your TRADING address (e.g., 0x043309...)
#   This is what you use for Activity Log and Positions API calls
# 
# • Your regular wallet address (e.g., 0x6F2E787B...) is your EOA wallet
#   Do NOT use this for API calls - it won't return any data!
# 
# • The VITE_ prefix is mandatory - without it, Vite won't expose
#   these variables to your browser code
#
# • Builder API credentials enable GASLESS trading - Polymarket pays all fees!
